## Observatory
OBSERVATORY_NAME OMM
TELESCOPE_NAME OMM
INSTRUMENT_NAME SpIOMM

## Instrumental parameters
FIELD_OF_VIEW 12 # Size of the field of view of the camera 1 in
		 # arc-minutes
PIX_SIZE_CAM1 20 # Size of one pixel of the camera 1 in um
PIX_SIZE_CAM2 15 # Size of one pixel of the camera 2 in um

## Disalignment guess
INIT_ANGLE 175. # Rough angle between images of the camera 1 and
		# images of the camera 2
INIT_DX -170. # Rough x axis disalignment in pixels (unbinned)
INIT_DY -375. # Rough y axis disalignment in pixels (unbinned)

## Calibration parameters
CALIB_NM_LASER 632.816 # Wavelength of the calibration laser in nm
CALIB_ORDER 30 # Folding order of the calibration cube
CALIB_STEP_SIZE 9765 # Step size of the calibration cube

## Processing parameters
DIV_NB 3 # Number of "Quad" division along one axis of a cube (the
	 # total number of quadrants is thus DIV_NB^2)
INIT_BOX_SIZE 15 # Size of the box created around a star to fit its
		 # parameters when stars FHWM is unknown
FWHM_COEFF 7 # When stars FWHM is known, this coefficient is used to
	     # define the size of the box created around a star to
	     # fit its parameters : BOX_SIZE = FWHM_COEFF * FWHM.
OPTIM_DARK_CAM1 0 # Optimization routine for the dark of CAM 1 
OPTIM_DARK_CAM2 1 # Optimization routine for the dark of CAM 2
