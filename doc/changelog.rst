v1.0 Creation of ORB
********************

Major modification of ORBS architecture. All the shared content
originally in the ORBS module have been moved to ORB. This way, ORBS,
ORCS, OACS, IRIS and ORUS can share the same core module without
importing ORBS entirely each time. Conceptually ORBS, like the other
softwares, just wraps around ORB module and is not any more the
central part of the whole suite of softwares.

v1.1
****

Multi fit of stars
==================

* :py:meth:`~astrometry.fit_stars_in_frame` has been updated to fit
  multiple stars at the same time (see:
  :py:meth:`~cutils.multi_fit_stars`). The star fit is now way more
  robust.

USNO-B1 based star detection
============================

* :py:meth:`~astrometry.Astrometry.query_vizier` and
  :py:meth:`~astrometry.Astrometry.register` have been moved from
  :py:class:`orbs.process.Spectrum` so that the registration is part of
  the Astrometry module (which makes more sense). This way it is now
  possible to use a star catalogue like USNO-B1 to detect stars in the
  cube. It is not a default behaviour because extended emission region
  contains virtually no catalogued stars. This option can be useful for
  galaxies to avoid the confision of HII regions and stars.

v1.2
****

* :py:meth:`~cutils.multi_fit_stars` noise estimation
  enhanced. The initial estimation of the shift has also been updated.

* Minor bugs fix. This version is considered as a nearly stable
  version ready for release.

* :py:meth:`~cutils.multi_fit_stars` initial estimation enhanced (more
  robust and precise)
    
v1.2.1
======

* :py:meth:`~utils.transform_spectrum` and
  :py:meth:`~utils.transform_interferogram` adjusted to lose no energy
  in the transformation process.  They are able to treat wavenumber
  transformation (useful to avoid the mutiple interpolation nescessary
  to move from a regular wavenumber space to an iregular wavelength
  space back and forth)'
    
* new keywords in config.orb: FIELD_OF_VIEW_2, EXT_ILLUMINATION
    
* doc updated
    
* bug fix

v1.2.2
======

* :py:meth:`~utils.spectrum_mean_energy` and
  :py:meth:`~utils.interf_mean_energy` Cythonised to
  :py:meth:`~cutils.spectrum_mean_energy` and
  :py:meth:`~cutils.interf_mean_energy`.

* :py:class:`~core.OptionFile` enhanced to be used by
  :py:meth:`orbs.orbs.Orbs.__init__`.

ORCS integration
----------------

* new keywords in config.orb: OBS_LAT, OBS_LON, OBS_ALT for ORCS.

* new general keyword in OptionFile: INCLUDE, used to include the
  parameters of another option file.

* Warning messages are not displayed anymore when using the silent
  option with :py:class:`~core.Tools`

* move :py:meth:`orbs.orbs.Orbs._create_list_from_dir` to
  :py:meth:`~core.Tools._create_list_from_dir` to make this useful
  method accessible to ORCS.

* doc updated


ORB's scripts
-------------

* move ORB's scripts (dstack, combine, rollxz, rollyz, reduce) from
  orbs/scripts to orb/scripts so that only ORBS specific scripts are
  in orbs/scripts.

* create **unstack** script to unstack a cube into a set of frames

v1.2.3
======

* add :py:meth:`~utils.flambda2ABmag`

* change file globals.py for constants.py

* add :py:meth:`~core.Tools._get_basic_spectrum_header` to return a
  header for a 1D spectrum.

* :py:meth:`~core.Tools.write_fits` updated to create ds9 readable 1D
  FITS files.

* :py:meth:`~utils.fit_lines_in_vector` accepts a tuple for the
  parameter cov_pos. This tuple gives the lines that are
  covarying. This way, [NII] and Halpha can have different velocities,
  but the [NII] lines will share the same velocity, improving a lot
  the precision on their estimated velocity without being biased by
  the Halpha velocity.

* :py:meth:`~utils.fit_map` created. This function is a generalization
  of the old :py:meth:`orbs.process.Phase.fit_phase_map` which now use
  this general function also. The fitting process has been enhanced
  and is now more robust and use NaNs instead of zeros.

v1.2.4
======

Miscellaneous
-------------

* all scripts have been renamed to orb-*

* --nostar and --flat bug fixed. Cosmic ray detection will not be done
  if those options are given.

SITELLE data
------------

* new command: **orb-conf**. Its general purpose is to help the
  administrator to quickly change ORB configuration. Its first use is
  to change the configuration file depending on the used
  instrument. To change the configration file from spiomm to sitelle
  just type::

    orb-conf -i sitelle

  This command avoid the painful manual change of the config file. At
  each new version this command can be run to quickly (and safely)
  reconfigure ORB. Note that this function requires write rights on
  the ORB installation folder.

Sitelle image mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* if ORBS is in **sitelle mode** (if the configuration file points to
  config.sitelle.orb), SITELLE's data frames are handled at the core
  level. :py:meth:`~core.Tools.read_fits` accepts two new options:
  image_mode and chip_index. If image_mode is set to 'sitelle' and the
  chip index is 1 or 2, then the read_fits function will return only
  of the 2 chips (depending on the chip index). **Chip slicing** is
  handled by
  :py:meth:`~core.Tools._read_sitelle_chip`. :py:meth:`~core.Cube.__getitem__`
  has also been modified in the same way with the same new options. A
  parameter line can now be added to the very first line of the image
  list passed to the :py:class:`~core.Cube`. This line must be
  something like::
    
    # sitelle 1

  If the first keyword is sitelle, the second keyword is understood as
  the chip index to read. This way, :py:class:`~core.Cube` understand
  that the data is SITELLE's data and what chip has to be read.

* :py:meth:`~core.Tools._create_list_from_dir` now accepts the options
  image_mode and chip_index and creates the parameter line at the very
  beginning of the output file list.

* **overscan** :py:meth:`~core.Tools._read_sitelle_chip` automatically
  substract the bias level given by the overscan areas of the returned
  image. This default behaviour can be canceled in the future.

Prebinning
~~~~~~~~~~

Used for faster computation of big data set. It
can also be useful if the user simply wants binned data. At the user
level only one option must be passed to the option file::

  PREBINNING 2 # Data is prebinned by 2

.. warning:: The real binning of the original data must be kept to the
   same values. The user must no modify the the values of BINCAM1 and
   BINCAM2.

* if this option is set :py:meth:`~core.Tools._create_list_from_dir`
  just adds the following directive at the beginning of the image list
  file::

    # prebinning 2

* :py:meth:`~core.Tools.read_fits` accepts the option
  'binning'. :py:meth:`~core.Tools._image_binning` has been created to
  bin 2D data efficiently. :py:meth:`~core.Cube.__getitem__` has been
  modified to read and treat transparently the new prebinning
  directive that is added at the beginning of an image list file.


v1.2.4.1
========

* Enhanced frame
  registration. :py:meth:`~astrometry.Astrometry.register` now takes
  full advantage of the multi fit of stars and filters the best stars
  by SNR. A double fit is also done at the beginning to ensure that
  the positions pattern is the best possible.

* bug fix, minimum number of good fitted pixels in a column for a
  phase fit lowered to 1/3 of the column length instead of 1/2.

v1.2.4.2
========

Astropy
-------

Astropy (http://www.astropy.org/) is definitly needed, pyfits and
pywcs standalone modules are not needed anymore by ORBS (but they
still can be used by other modules ;) even modules imported by ORBS so
becarefull before removing them)

* PYFITS: now imported from astropy.io.fits
* PYWCS: now imported from astropy.wcs


Better Star fit
---------------

* :py:meth:`~cutils.multi_fit_stars`: tilted background added to the model

* detected stars are selected not too far from the center of the
  frame

* star box coeff set to 10 instead of 7 to get a better sky statistic
  around stars.


SpIOMM bias overscan for camera 2
---------------------------------

When it exists, the bias overscan created with each frame of the
camera 2 is used to remove automatically the bias. Note that in this
case **the path to the bias frames must not be given to ORBS** because
ORBS will try to create a master bias and remove it at step 3. In
fact, the mean of the master bias will be near 0 because the overscan
is removed from the bias frames also. The impact of giving the path to
the bias frame is thus not dramatic. But it is better not to give it.

Miscellaneous
-------------
* :py:meth:`~astrometry.Astrometry.register` optimization routine is
  based on a least square fit instead of a powell algorithm.

* transfered :py:meth:`~cutils.part_value` from OACS cutils.

* :py:meth:`~astrometry.Astrometry.get_alignment_vectors` simplified
  because the multi fit mode is now robust enough to remove all which
  was written for the preceding individual fit mode.

* :py:meth:`~utils.indft`, :py:meth:`~cutils.indft` added to compute
  Inverse Non-uniform Discret Fourier Transform (INDFT). New option
  **sampling_vector** in :py:meth:`~utils.transform_spectrum` to give
  the possibility to compute an INDFT by giving a non-uniform sampling
  vector.

v1.3 Start of CFHT integration
******************************

v1.3.0 ORB-Viewer
=================

A viewer based on Ginga (https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga) has been
added to ORB (scripts/**orb-viewer**). It can be used to analyse
reduced data cube (spectral cube) or raw interferometric cubes. Basic
functionalities (fft, spectrum fit, image operations ...)  have been
implemented.

v1.3.1
======

orb-header
----------

script **orb-header** added to display and manipulate headers of FITS
files.


Miscellaneous
-------------

* All classes which inherit from :py:class:`~core.Tools` can be passed
  all Tools arguments even if the __init__ method has been
  reimplemented (a new cofiguration file path can thus be defined
  easily)

* :py:meth:`~astrometry.Astrometry.register` enhanced to compute scale
  only at the center of the frame. This function can now be used to
  compute the optical distorsion pattern of an image.

* :py:meth:`~astrometry.fit_star`: 'saturation' option added to avoid
  saturated pixels during a the fit of a star. Allows for saturated
  star reconstruction of the real flux.


* :py:meth:`~utils.compute_line_fwhm`,
  py:meth:`~utils.compute_line_shift`
  py:meth:`~utils.compute_radial_velocity` transfered from ORCS to
  ORB.


* script **orb-dstack** can be given a directory instead of a file
  list. It is now able to filter SITELLE files to get only the
  'object', 'dark' or 'flat' type files.

v1.3.2
======

* :py:meth:`~core.Tools._read_sitelle_chip` : bias is now computed on
  half of the overscan part, because the pixel on the very border of
  the overscan have a bad value.

* order 0: all functions in :py:mod:`~utils` which need the order
  parameter have been modified to accept order 0 only when possible
  (e.g. :py:meth:`~utils.transform_interferogram` cannot give an
  output in nm at order 0). If the order 0 is not possible, those
  functions raise an Exception.

* :py:meth:`~cutils.map_me` added to map the modulation efficiency on
  a laser frame.

* :py:meth:`~astrometry.aperture_photometry` has been made more robust
  to NaNs

* config files updated for SpIOMM and SITELLE.

scripts
-------

* **orb-aligner**: graphical inteface created to help in
  manually align images if needed.

* **orb-bin**: script made to bin images.

* **orb-header** changed a lot to manage list of files and output list
  of keyword values.

* **orb-viewer** updated to manage SITELLE's files better

v1.3.3
======

Alignement
----------

The alignment procedure has been completely changed and is now more
than ten times faster. Two steps only are required: One brute force
step (:py:meth:`astrometry.Astrometry.brute_force`) based on fast
photometry and a fine fit step to get all alignment parameters.

:py:class:`astrometry.Aligner` has been created which manage the
alignment procedure.


SIP/Distorsion
--------------

Computation of the SIP (Simple Imaging Polynomial) distorsion
correction has been implemented in
:py:meth:`astrometry.Astrometry.register`. All the geometrical
transformation functions in :py:mod:`utils` and the multi star
fitting procedure :py:meth:`astrometry.fit_stars_in_frame` have been
updated.


HDF5
----

:py:class:`astrometry.StarsParams` saves its data in HDF5 format to
provide an easier and more robust way of accessing and viewing the
parameters. The module h5py is now required to use ORB.


v1.3.4.0
========

Binning detection
-----------------

* keywords **CAM1_DETECTOR_SIZE_X**, **CAM1_DETECTOR_SIZE_Y**,
  **CAM2_DETECTOR_SIZE_X**, **CAM2_DETECTOR_SIZE_Y** added to the
  configuration file to help automatic detection of the image
  binning.

* :py:meth:`~utils.compute_binning` added to compute image binning.



v1.3.4.1
========


Doc update
----------


Miscellaneous
-------------

* :py:meth:`~utils.optimize_phase` added to optimize a linear phase
  vector based on the minimization of the imaginary part. Can be used
  to get the phase of a laser spectrum (with no continuum emission).



v1.4 The HDF5 miracle
*********************

All ORBS internal cubes used for computation have been passed to an
HDF5 format which makes data loading incredibly faster. If those
changes have small effects on small data cubes like SpIOMM data, it
changes a lot the computation time on SITELLE's data cubes (passing
from ~10 hours to 6.5 hours on a 16 procs machine).

The HDF5 format is also very useful to display large data cubes with
**orb-viewer** without loading the full cube in memory.


v1.4.0
======

* :py:class:`~core.HDFCube` created. It inherits of
  :py:class:`~core.Cube` but it is built over an HDF5 cube. An HDF5
  cube is similar to a frame-divided cube but all the frames are
  merged in one HDF5 file. Only some specific methods (especially the
  __getitem__ special method) had to be rewritten.

* :py:class:`~core.OutHDFCube` created. The classes
  :py:class:`~core.HDFCube` and :py:class:`~core.Cube` have been built
  to read data but not to write it.  :py:class:`~core.OutHDFCube` has
  been designed to write an HDF5 cube containing the transformed data.

* :py:meth:`~core.Cube.export` modified to export any cube (e.g. a
  frame divided FITS cube) in HDF5 format.

* script **orb-dstack** can also export a cube in hdf5 format.

Visual module
-------------

New module created :py:mod:`orb.visual` aimed to contain basic visual
classes to construct viewer in other ORB softwares like ORBS, IRIS,
ORCS...

* :py:class:`orb.visual.BaseViewer`, :py:class:`orb.visual.PopupWindow`,
  :py:class:`orb.visual.HeaderWindow`, :py:class:`orb.visual.ZPlotWindow`
  created to display FITS/HDF5 cubes.

Orb-viewer
----------

The basic viewer **orb-viewer** has been completly rewritten. It has
less functionnality than the previous one, but it is nearly bug-free
and much better coded. Its frame will serve as a basic frame for more
specialized viewer (e.g. **iris-viewer** of IRIS and other to come for
ORCS).


Data module
-----------

Module :py:mod:`~data` used to propagate uncertainty when doing
operations on 1D or 2D data. Useful for IRIS and OACS.

* :py:class:`~data.Data1D`, :py:class:`~data.Data2D`,
  :py:class:`~data.Data` and some convenience functions created.

Miscellaneous
-------------

:py:meth:`orb.astrometry.StarsParams.load_stars_parameters` and
:py:meth:`orb.astrometry.StarsParams.save_stars_parameters` changed to
output the parameters in HDF5 format. saving and loading is much
more efficient.


v1.5: Handing SITELLE's real data cubes
***************************************

v1.5.0
======

Phase correction
----------------

SITELLE's phase map is nearly ideal so that a **better kind of phase
correction is possible**. Now, the 'order 0 phase map' depends only on
the OPD path i.e. the incident angle of the light (if we consider that
the surfaces ot the interferometer's optics are perfect, which seems
to be a good enough assumption up to now). The order 0 phase map can
thus be modeled directly from the calibration laser map which gives
the incident angle at each pixels. As the calibration laser map can be
tilted (2 angles along X and Y axes) and rotated around its center,
the model must take into account all those 3 parameters.

There are at least two major **advantages**:

  * We have an **understood model** with physical parameters to fit
    the phase map (and the fitting approximation is really great,
    giving a gaussian shaped error distribution with no apparent bias
    or skewness).

  * **We get the real calibration laser map** which corresponds to the
    scientific cube and not a calibration laser map taken in different
    conditions (gravity vector, temperature and so on).

* :py:meth:`~utils.tilt_calibration_laser_map` and :py:meth:`~utils.fit_sitelle_phase_map` created to fit a sitelle's phase map.

Point source detection
----------------------

:py:meth:`~astrometry.Astrometry.detect_all_sources` detects all
point sources in a cube (HII regions, distant galaxies, stars and
filamentary knots can be detected). This method is used to shield the
point sources during the cosmic ray detection and will be certainly
useful for automatic point source extraction.

3D Viewer
---------

A 3D viewer has been created (**orb-viewer3d**) based on vispy library
(http://vispy.org) which is an easy to use OpenGL API. It is still at
a development level but it works well enough to travel into spectral cubes and  make beautiful 3D videos.

Miscellaneous
-------------

:py:meth:`~utils.transform_interferogram` does not make any use of the
old low resolution phase computation
(:py:meth:`~utils.get_lr_phase`). The phase can be directly obtained
at the output and the internally computed phase used for auto-phasing
is also obtained with this function. A low resolution phase is no more
useful as it does not give a better precisin on the fit. A full
length phase vector is now computed every time the phase is needed.



v1.5.1
======


HDF5 Final output format
------------------------

The final output format is now an HDF5 cube. A FITS cube can then be
obtained by using the script **orb-extract**. The HDF5 cube can be
handled directly by ORCS.

Complex data cubes
------------------

:py:class:`~core.HDFCube` and :py:class:`~core.OutHDFCube` now handles
complex data sets. If a complex data cube is opened returned data will
be complex. The user of the class must make sure that the complex data
is not hardly cast to float (a warning is raised in this case).

The full complex spectral cube is generated whichs helps in checking
that the energy contained in the imaginary part is a small percentage
of the energy contained in the real part, giving the possibility to
check if the phase correction is correct. This check is made during
the calibration step.

No more automatic logging
-------------------------

Automatic logging originally handled by :py:class:`~core.Tools` is now
handled by :py:class:`~core.Logger` which must be initialised by the
main script. No more logfile name has to be passed to
:py:class:`~core.Tools` or its subclasses.


:py:class:`~core.Tools` which was used to ensure the use of the same
logfile for all the launched processes has also been suppressed.


Calibration laser map fit
-------------------------

:py:meth:`~utils.fit_calibration_laser_map`: The residual of the
modelized fit of the calibration laser map is now fitted with a 2D
polynomial. The precision is of the order of 10 m/s which gives enough
precision to remove the fitting error on small calibration laser
cubes. This error could be seen as small fringes on high precision
velocity maps. It is thus better to fit the obtained calibration laser
map when it is used to calibrate a cube. The script
**orbs-fit-calibration-laser-map** hase been created for that.


Phase map fit
-------------

:py:meth:`~utils.simulate_calibration_laser_map`, 
:py:meth:`~utils.fit_calibration_laser_map` and 
:py:meth:`~utils.fit_sitelle_phase_map` have been updated to deliver 
a much more precise fit. But you must note that the calibration laser 
map delivered during the fitting procedure is still not good enough
for using as a real calibration laser map. this comes from the
residual which must be taken into account. This might come in the
future (see above).

2D viewer
---------

2D Viewer has been updated to handle colormaps. Different shapes
(circle and square) and different combining methods (mean, median,
sum) of the regions are possible. A fitting module process has been
added to the spectrum window. Some bugs have also been corrected.


Miscellaneous
-------------

* :py:meth:`~astrometry.aperture_photometry` and
  :py:meth:`~astrometry.fit_stars_in_frame` can now return
  photometrical data without background sustraction. This is used in
  source extraction (less noisy for faint sources).


* The implementation of :py:meth:`~core.Cube.get_quadrant_dims` has
  been moved to :py:meth:`~core.Tools.get_quadrant_dims`.

* :py:meth:`~cutils.nanbin_image` and
  :py:meth:`~cutils.unbin_image` created to bin and unbin images
  during phase maps fitting. It permits to accelerate the process a
  lot without losing precision.

* :py:meth:`~utils.compute_line_fwhm` now computes the line fwhm
  from the number of steps on the longest side of the interferogram
  (before this was computed from the total number of steps of a
  symmetric interferogram, so generally two times more steps than in
  this version).

v1.6: Architectural changes
***************************

v1.6.0
======

A lot of changes have been made. Only the most important are summarized.

Architecture
------------

The old orb/utils.py has been transformed into a real module:
:ref:`utils-module`, utils function have been ordered by type:
astrometry, fft, spectrum, vector, image, stats, parallel, web ...

A Gaussian convoluted with a Sinc line can now be fitted using a
function created by Simon Prunet, see: :py:meth:`~cutils.sincgauss1d`


New Fit classes
---------------

The whole fit concept has been enhanced. A fitting module has been
created (:py:mod:`~fit`, see :ref:`fit-module`) It is now governed by a Fit class
(:py:class:`fit.FitVector`) which can aggregates models based on a
Template class (:py:class:`fit.Model`).

Compression
-----------

A small compression of the HDF5 files is now automaticcaly done. It
slows the process but makes the siez of the reduction file on disk
much smaller.

Adaptation to SITELLE
---------------------

**Phase correction** and **cosmic-ray detection** have been reworked. Cosmic
ray detection now uses both cubes and is much more robust than before.


v.1.6.1
=======


Zernike Modes Fit
-----------------

* External module :py:mod:`orb.ext.zern` added to fit Zernike
  modes. This module has been created by Tim van Werkhoven
  (werkhoven@strw.leidenuniv.nl).

New module utils.IO
-------------------

* module :py:mod:`orb.utils.io` created to put input/output functions
  related to write/read FITS and HDF5 single files.

Miscellaneous
-------------

* :py:meth:`~astrometry.Astrometry.brute_force_guess` Brute force
  guess extended to cover a wider region by default. Initial guess on
  dx and dy can be very rough. All alignement are successful on
  SITELLE with the same set of parameters even with major optics
  change.



* :py:meth:`~cutils.get_nm_axis_step`,
  :py:meth:`~cutils.get_nm_axis_max`,
  :py:meth:`~cutils.get_nm_axis_min`,
  :py:meth:`~cutils.get_cm1_axis_step`,
  :py:meth:`~cutils.get_cm1_axis_max`,
  :py:meth:`~cutils.get_cm1_axis_min`, changed to take into account the
  fact that the spectral axis created from
  :py:meth:`orb.utils.fft.transform_interferogram` has 1 sample less than
  expected to keep the same number of sample at the input and the
  output.

* :py:mod:`orb.viewer` updated for the last matplotlib version (1.5.1).


v.1.6.2
=======


Photometry
----------

* Standard class moved from orbs/process.py to core.py.
* new utils/photometry.py


QuadCube
--------

* New major upgrade working.

Miscellaneous
-------------

* brute_force_guess made more robust (frame is cleaned from all other
  things than detected stars to remove bad brilliant object
  --e.g. saturated stars--)
* brute_force_guess made faster by moving the core functions to
  cutils.py

v.1.6.3
-------

* star photometry is now computed on the axis at the center of the
  frame instead of the axis at 0 degrees (interferometer axis). This
  way the filter and standrd curve are well centered instead of beeing
  moved too much to the left and cut (which was resulting in an
  underestimation of a few percent on the std star theoretical flux).

* :py:meth:`~astrometry.Astrometry.register` : registration is now
  only made by photometry optimization (brute force) and does not rely
  on fit because the distorsion are too big to give correct fit
  results. If it can be less precise (a precision better than 1 pixel
  is impossible by definition) it is much more robust. Note that after
  all distorsion are bigger than 3 to 4 pixels.


v.2. Data Release 1
*******************

This is a major version corresponding to the first Data Release of
SITELLE made in March 2016.

v.2.0-DR1-beta
==============

OutHDFQuadCube
--------------

Quad divided HDF cube. Much much faster when dealing with quads or
spectra. This is now the default HDF5 cube for the final output and
all the spectrum related processes like spectrum computation and
calibration.

Photometry
----------

* Standard class moved from ORBS to ORB. This class manage standard
  related files and compute a estimated flux in a frame.

* A lot has been developped to compute a precise estimation of the
  number of counts. All the functions related to photometry have been
  stored in utils/photometry.py.


Fit module
----------

The fit module is now stable and robust. Models can be easily created
and aggregated to a global model. Model for continuum, emission lines
and filter have been designed.


Compression
-----------

Compression has been removed. Even a small compression slows down the
process too much.It could be used for archiving though.


Miscellaneous
-------------

* smooothing_deg option in
  :py:meth:`orb.utils.fft.transform_interferogram` has 1 sample less
  than replaced by a more robust smoothing_coeff option. The smoohting
  degree is now defined as smoothing_coeff * interferogram_size. In a
  general way the smoothing degree (the number of samples smoothed at
  a transition between a part of zeros and a part of signal in the
  interferogram) is now bigger because -25/+100 interferogram present
  a very sharp transition on the left side whcih is very near ZPD and
  create large wiggles in the spectra. A higher smoothing degree is the solution.
